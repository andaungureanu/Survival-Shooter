# Survival-Shooter
A simple survival shooter game in which the player has to shoot or dodge the incoming enemies in order to stay alive and
win. If the player is touched by an enemy he will lose hp. In order to win, the player has to survive long
enough so that he can score a number of points (one enemy killed - one point).
